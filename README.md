 ##Personal Learning
 This project was fun yet challenging as I applied my existing HTML and CSS knowledge with more ease than I did the first time around in project 1. The addition of "SASSing" up our CSS along with dividing up the portions by partials was helpful in keeping my stylesheet organized and easier to keep track of. Being heavy in javascript, this was the most challenging part of the project for me but once I gained a better understanding of proper syntax and where to put my codes (to affect what) it didn't seem so tough anymore. Overall, building instanews has re-enforced my understanding of styling with CSS while learning new tricks (ie. animations/transitions). Putting my knowledge of javascript to work has helped me understand it a lot better and increased my confidence in my abilities to write code. It was tough and a lot of problem solving but it encouraged me to persevere and approach problems from different directions.
